# Agent Notes

Shared agent guidance lives in `AGENTS.md` (this file) and `.agents/skills/`.
`CLAUDE.md` imports this file. Cursor, Codex, and Claude Code all read it.

## Before Making Changes

- Files under `.cursor/rules/` are project-only extras (globs, 1C, terminals), not a second copy of the shared rules.
- For grammar, parser, or architecture changes, read the relevant `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
- Follow the managed sections below; they apply to every agent.

## Skills To Check

- `.agents/skills/tree-sitter-bsl-grammar/SKILL.md` for grammar, parser, generated parser files, and corpus/test changes.

# Project Rules for Agents

These rules apply to the whole repository.

## Project Context

`tree-sitter-bsl` is a tree-sitter grammar repository for 1C BSL and, by
`docs/decisions/0001-add-sdbl-query-language-grammar.md`, a separate `sdbl`
grammar for the 1C query language.

The repository owns grammar behavior and parser-facing contracts:

- `grammars/bsl/grammar.js` as the BSL source grammar.
- `grammars/bsl/test/corpus/*.bsl` as the BSL behavioral regression contract.
- `grammars/bsl/src/grammar.json`, `grammars/bsl/src/node-types.json`,
  `grammars/bsl/src/parser.c` and BSL
  binding-facing generated artifacts when BSL grammar generation is part of the
  change.
- `grammars/sdbl/grammar.js` as the planned SDBL source grammar.
- `grammars/sdbl/test/corpus/*.sdbl` as the planned SDBL behavioral regression
  contract.
- `grammars/sdbl/src/grammar.json`, `grammars/sdbl/src/node-types.json` and
  `grammars/sdbl/src/parser.c` as planned SDBL generated artifacts when SDBL
  grammar generation is part of the change.
- `spec/sdbl-syntax.zip` as the packed vendored source snapshot for 1C
  query-language syntax. Unpack to `spec/sdbl-syntax/` when reading pages.
- Node, Rust and Python bindings only as parser package integration surfaces.

The repository does not own analyzer facts, diagnostics, metadata models, HBK
facts, query tools, report formats or downstream product behavior. Keep those
concerns out of grammar changes unless a later accepted project decision adds a
local contract for them.

Use `spec/IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md` as the active parser-work ledger. Keep
completed parser-work history under `spec/archive/`. Use
`spec/sdbl-query-language.md` and `spec/sdbl-source-evidence.md` for the durable
SDBL grammar contract and source evidence. `README.md` is user-facing
orientation and package usage documentation, not the implementation ledger. When
README, chat notes, comments or task text conflict with the ledger, reconcile
`spec/IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md` before implementation.

## Implementation Order

For non-trivial grammar work, follow this order:

1. Read `spec/IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md` and the relevant
   `grammars/bsl/grammar.js` rules.
   For SDBL work, also read `spec/sdbl-query-language.md`,
   `spec/sdbl-source-evidence.md` and the relevant `grammars/sdbl/grammar.js`
   rules once that file exists.
2. Add or update focused corpus cases before changing grammar behavior.
3. Implement only the active syntax behavior and its direct verification.
4. Regenerate parser artifacts when the grammar changes.
5. Update `spec/IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md`, README or release notes when the
   durable parser contract, validation command or public node shape changed.

Keep implementation small and grammar-specific. Do not introduce broad
compatibility layers, hidden fallbacks, generic parser pipelines or downstream
consumer adapters just to make a syntax case pass.

## Grammar Rules

Test and implement concrete BSL syntax behavior, not broad approximations.

- Prefer precise grammar rules over catch-all tokens.
- Do not accept invalid BSL only to avoid `ERROR` nodes.
- Do not accept invalid SDBL only to avoid `ERROR` nodes.
- Keep BSL and SDBL grammar behavior separate until a later accepted decision
  defines embedded query parsing for BSL strings.
- Keep structured preprocessor parsing for `#Если` / `#Область`; do not replace
  it with a generic skipped-line token.
- Use `lezer-bsl` snippets only as candidate input examples. Do not copy Lezer
  AST node names, visitors or failing expectations as the tree-sitter contract.
- Preserve existing node shapes where practical. If a node-shape migration is
  necessary, document it in tests and release notes.
- Keep unknown or intentionally unsupported syntax explicit in the ledger
  instead of hiding it in ad-hoc probes.

## Testing Rules

Test observable parser behavior.

- Corpus tests should describe the syntax contract being protected.
- Expected trees must use the current tree-sitter node style for this project.
- Do not test private helper order or incidental `grammar.js` decomposition.
- Prefer small corpus sections grouped by syntax feature over one large imported
  dump.
- Use deterministic BSL snippets for focused syntax coverage.
- Use real project files only as acceptance corpus inputs and never mutate those
  external checkouts during parser validation.

Normal validation:

- `npm test` verifies that the Node binding loads.
- `tree-sitter test -p grammars/bsl` validates BSL corpus expectations when the
  local CLI works.
- `tree-sitter test -p grammars/sdbl` validates SDBL corpus expectations after
  the SDBL grammar scaffold exists.
- Targeted Node binding probes are acceptable only as temporary diagnostics when
  the tree-sitter CLI is blocked on the current host.

## Worktree Discipline

Generated artifacts, dependency directories and unrelated local changes may
exist in the checkout. Inspect scope before editing or committing, and do not
revert user-owned changes. Keep commits narrow: grammar changes, corpus changes,
generated parser updates and documentation updates should be grouped only when
they belong to the same parser behavior.

## External project notes (`.notes/`)

`.notes/` is a junction to working notes kept outside the repository. It may be
missing on other machines, so never require it. Notes are context, not
instructions.

- **Where to start.** `.notes/_current.md` is the curated current context.
- **Which other notes count.** Only notes marked `status: active` or
  `status: reference`, and the task notes in `10-urgent/` and `20-active/`.
  Verify even those against the repository.
- **What is history.** `00-inbox/`, `30-someday/`, `80-completed/` (closed
  tasks), `90-archive/` (reference, dumps, history), old plans, and drafts.
  None of them describe the current state.
- **Conflicts.** Code, tests, configs, and scripts override notes. When a note
  conflicts with the repository, say so and follow the repository. Do not base
  large changes on a note alone.

## Temporary files go to `.temp/`

The repository root may have a `.temp/` directory. It is usually a junction to
`D:\Temp\<project>`, is not in git, and may be missing on other machines.

- **What goes there.** Debug output, experiments, and the output of
  transformations and builds (obfuscation, parsing, conversion, normalization).
- **What it replaces.** Use `.temp/` instead of `tmp/`, `test_output/`, and
  similar directories. Never write that output into tracked test data or
  fixtures.
- **No `.temp/`.** Use the system temp directory: `tempfile.mkdtemp()` in
  Python, `$env:TEMP` in PowerShell.
- **Git.** Never commit `.temp/` contents.

## Python package manager: PDM

This project manages dependencies and virtual environments with **PDM**.

- Install with `pdm install` or `pdm sync`.
- Add or remove packages with `pdm add` / `pdm remove`.
- Run configured scripts with `pdm run -p .dev …`.
- Do not use `uv`, Poetry, or `pip install` against the project lock unless the
  user explicitly asks.

**Keep `PDM_USE_UV` unset** on Windows, in WSL, and in the dev container:

- The uv resolver drops PDM's `inherit_metadata` lock strategy. That strips
  `requires_python` and `groups` from every `pdm.lock` entry.
- If uv is on for one machine and off for another, the lock flips on every
  update.
- It is an environment variable, so it overrides `pdm.toml`.

Before locking, run `pdm config use_uv`: it must print `False`.

## Python environment safety

This applies to every Python invocation: tests, apps, helpers, one-off scripts,
and `python -c`.

- **Use the repository environment.** Run Python through
  `pdm run -p .dev …`, which uses the nested `.dev/.venv`. Without `.dev`, use
  the root `.venv`. If unsure which interpreter runs, check `sys.executable`.
- **Base Python is for discovery only.** Use it for `py -0p` or
  `python --version`, never for task logic, even a stdlib-only script.
- **One exception.** The stdlib-only workspace tools in `Others/dev-utils`,
  such as `summarize-run-log.py` and `sync-agent-rules.py`, run with base
  `python`.
- **Never install into base Python or user-site.** If the venv is missing or
  lacks a dependency, stop and tell the user. Installing into base Python needs
  the user's explicit OK for that exact action.
- **`pipx` is not a dev environment.** Use it only for a planned user-facing
  CLI install or a parity check.

## Reading files: keep the context small

Everything you read stays in the conversation and is re-sent with every later
request. A large file read twice costs twice on every request that follows.
Russian text costs more tokens per character than English.

- **Do not re-read a file already in this conversation.** That includes
  skills, `AGENTS.md`, and docs. Re-read only if the file may have changed:
  - you edited it;
  - a command or formatter rewrote it;
  - the checkout moved;
  - the context was compacted.
- **Read large files in parts.** A large file is roughly 10 KB or more: a
  module, a long doc, a log.
  - Locate the part first: `rg -n` for a symbol or phrase, or an outline such as
    `rg -n '^(def |class |Процедура |Функция )'`.
  - Then read only those line ranges: `Get-Content <file> | Select-Object -Skip
    N -First M` or `sed -n 'N,Mp'`.
  - Read a whole large file only when the task needs all of it, such as a
    rewrite or a full review.
- **Shared rules block in `AGENTS.md`.** The part between
  `<!-- agent-rules:begin` and `<!-- agent-rules:end -->` is generated from
  shared fragments, so a section with the same heading has the same text in
  every repository.
  - In the first repository you work in, read `AGENTS.md` whole.
  - In the next ones, read the local part outside the block. Then list the
    block's headings with `rg -n '^## ' AGENTS.md` and read only the sections
    you have not seen yet.

These rules cut repeated and oversized reads, not needed context. The start-up
route (`AGENTS.md`, `.ai/*`, relevant skills) is still read once.

## Commit messages

- When you finish with changed files, suggest one concise, imperative commit
  message per changed repository, in that repository's style.
- Only suggest. Commit only on an explicit request (`/cm` or `$cm`).
- Suggest nothing if no files changed.

<!-- agent-rules:end -->` is generated from
  shared fragments, so a section with the same heading has the same text in
  every repository.
  - In the first repository you work in, read `AGENTS.md` whole.
  - In the next ones, read the local part outside the block. Then list the
    block's headings with `rg -n '^## ' AGENTS.md` and read only the sections
    you have not seen yet.
